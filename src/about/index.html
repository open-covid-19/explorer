            <h3 class="centered">Where does the data come from?</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                The dataset used to perform the forecasting is the
                <a href="https://github.com/open-covid-19/data">Open COVID-19 Dataset</a>, which
                contains total confirmed positive cases and total fatal cases for all reporting
                countries as well as subregions of USA, Spain and China.
            </p>

            <h3 class="centered">How often is the data updated?</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Data is updated daily for most countries and subregions. It's also worth noting that
                the dates in the data represent when the data is reported to the relevant authorities,
                like WHO or ECDC, which is normally done the following day.
            </p>

            <h3 class="centered">How is the forecasting done?</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                The forecasting is done by fitting the data to a specialized logistic curve, called
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function">Gompertz function</a>. For a
                walkthrough of why this was chosen over other potential models, see the
                <a href="https://github.com/open-covid-19/data/blob/master/examples/logistic_modeling.ipynb">relevant analysis</a>.
