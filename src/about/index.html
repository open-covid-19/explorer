        <p class="justify">
            The dataset used in the Open COVID-19 map is the
            <a href="https://github.com/open-covid-19/data">Open COVID-19 Dataset</a>, which
            contains total confirmed positive cases and total fatal cases for all reporting
            countries as well as subregions of Australia, China, Italy, Spain and USA.
        </p>

        <h3 class="centered">How often is the data updated?</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            Data is updated daily for most countries and subregions. It's also worth noting that
            the dates in the data represent when the data is reported to the relevant authorities,
            like WHO or ECDC, which is normally done the following day.
        </p>

        <h3 class="centered">How is the forecast done?</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            The forecast is done by fitting the data to a specialized logistic curve, called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function">Gompertz function</a>. For
            a walk-through of why this model was chosen over other potential alternatives, see

                analysis</a>.
